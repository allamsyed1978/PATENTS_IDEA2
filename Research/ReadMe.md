**Unique Aspects of Your Idea:**

**Real-Time Impression Tracking:**
Your framework emphasizes real-time tracking of customer impressions and engagement metrics to determine optimal ad insertion points. This focus on immediate data analysis for ad placement may offer a novel approach.

**Dynamic Revenue Sharing Based on Impression Quality:**
The proposed system allocates revenue dynamically based on impression quality, view duration, and demographic alignment. While revenue-sharing models exist, the specific criteria and real-time adjustments you propose could be distinctive.

**Geographic and Demographic Targeting for Both VOD and Linear Content:**
Incorporating targeted ad placements across both video-on-demand and linear streaming content, tailored to geographic and demographic profiles, adds a layer of specificity that may not be fully addressed in existing patents.
