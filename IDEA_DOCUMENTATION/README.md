Dynamic Ad Insertion and Revenue Optimization Framework for Streaming Platforms

**Title of the Invention:**
Dynamic Ad Insertion and Revenue Optimization Framework for Streaming Platforms

**Abstract:**
This invention pertains to a dynamic ad insertion framework for video-on-demand (VOD) and linear streaming platforms. The system leverages real-time client impressions and viewership data to optimize ad placement, enhancing campaign effectiveness and improving user experience. Additionally, a dynamic revenue-sharing model ensures equitable allocation based on impression quality, engagement, and demographic targeting. The framework also supports geographic and demographic-based ad targeting to maximize relevance and ROI for advertisers while reducing viewer disruption.

**Background of the Invention:**
The rapid growth of streaming platforms has created significant opportunities for targeted advertising. However, existing ad insertion technologies lack real-time adaptability, leading to inefficient ad placements and suboptimal revenue distribution. Additionally, many current systems fail to account for geographic and demographic factors, resulting in lower engagement and audience dissatisfaction.

This invention aims to overcome these limitations by introducing a dynamic, real-time ad insertion and revenue optimization framework, tailored to modern streaming environments.

**Detailed Description of the Invention**

**1. Overview**
The framework integrates advanced data analytics, impression tracking, and dynamic algorithms to place ads in streaming content based on real-time viewer interactions. It includes:

Real-time customer impressions tracking.
Dynamic revenue-sharing mechanisms.
Geographic and demographic targeting capabilities.

**2. Core Components**

**a. Customer Impressions Tracking:**

**Functionality:**
Monitors real-time impressions, engagement metrics, and viewer interaction patterns.
**Technology:** 
Uses machine learning algorithms to predict optimal ad placement based on viewer behavior, such as pauses, rewinds, or natural breaks in content.
