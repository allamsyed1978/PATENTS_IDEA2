**Diagram Explanation:**

**Content Streaming:**

The viewer begins streaming content (VOD or linear) on the StreamingPlatform.
The platform sends real-time engagement data to the ImpressionTracker.
**Ad Request:**

The StreamingPlatform requests an ad from the AdServer, providing impression and engagement data.
The AdServer uses the GeoDemographicService to fetch location-based and audience-targeting data.

**Ad Selection and Revenue Allocation:**

The AdServer communicates with the RevenueModelEngine to evaluate ad performance potential and calculate revenue splits dynamically.
The AdServer delivers the selected ad to the StreamingPlatform for insertion.
**Ad Engagement Tracking:**

The ImpressionTracker monitors the viewerâ€™s interaction with the ad and updates the RevenueModelEngine for real-time revenue adjustments.
If the viewer skips or disengages, the platform adjusts future ad frequency or type to minimize disruption.
**Real-Time Updates:**

The ContentSource provides updated data (e.g., trending content or new demographics) to the GeoDemographicService.
The AdServer dynamically adjusts ad insertion points based on this data.
**Content Resumption:**

After the ad is displayed, the StreamingPlatform resumes content playback seamlessly for the viewer.
